# 💥Introduction💥
Welcome to Riskless Roulette, an eerie yet thrilling luck-based game where every pull of the trigger can either make you rich... or end your run. This version is entirely digital, in contrast to traditional Russian Roulette, but the tension is real. Every gun has it's own number of chambers, money multiplier, and death odds. <br> 

<i><strong>Step in, load your gun, bet everything you can, and pray before 'CLICK'</strong></i>

# 📜Game Description📜
Riskless Roulette is a Java programm game that simulates betting/gambling using various firearms, each with different chamber sizes and reward multipliers.<br><br>
You start with <strong>₱1000</strong>. Place a bet, choose your gun, load how many bullets you want, and pull the trigger.<br><br>
<strong>Survive a shot</strong> -> multiply your bet based on the gun and chamber multiplier.<br>
<strong>If a bullet comes out</strong> -> you lose and your run will end.<br><br>
Every decision counts:
- What gun will you choose?
- How many bullets will you load?
- How much will you bet?
- Will you push your luck.... or walk away?
